\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{var_stem}{A character vector containing at least one element, each
representing either a variable stem or a full variable name found in \code{data}.}

\item{group}{A character string representing a variable name or a pattern
used to search for variables in \code{data}.}

\item{var_input}{A character string specifying whether the values supplied
to \code{var_stem} should be treated as variable stems (\code{stem}) or as complete
variable names (\code{name}). By default, this is set to \code{stem}, so the function
searches for variables that begin with each stem provided. Setting this
argument to \code{name} directs the function to look for variables that exactly
match the provided names.}

\item{regex_stem}{A logical value indicating whether to use Perl-compatible
regular expressions when searching for variable stems. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ignore_stem_case}{A logical value indicating whether the search for
columns matching the supplied \code{var_stem} is case-insensitive. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{group_type}{A character string that defines how the \code{group} argument
should be interpreted. Should be one of \code{pattern} or \code{variable}. Defaults
to \code{variable}, which searches for a matching variable name in \code{data}.}

\item{group_name}{An optional character string used to rename the \code{group}
column in the final table When \code{group_type} is set to \code{variable}, the column
name defaults to the matched variable name from \code{data}. When set to \code{pattern},
the default column name is \code{group}.}

\item{regex_group}{A logical value indicating whether to use Perl-compatible
regular expressions when searching for \code{group} variables or matching variable
name patterns. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ignore_group_case}{A logical value specifying whether the search for a
grouping variable (if \code{group_type} is \code{variable}) or for variables matching a
pattern (if \code{group_type} is \code{pattern}) should be case-insensitive. Default is
\code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to ignore case.}

\item{remove_group_non_alnum}{A logical value indicating whether to remove
all non-alphanumeric characters (i.e., anything that is not a letter or
number) from \code{group}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{na_removal}{A character string that specifies the method for handling
missing values: \code{pairwise} or \code{listwise}. Defaults to \code{listwise}.}

\item{only}{A character string or vector of character strings of the types of
summary data to return. Default is \code{NULL}, which returns both counts and
percentages. To return only counts or percentages, use \code{count} or \code{percent},
respectively.}

\item{var_labels}{An optional named character vector or list used to assign
custom labels to variable names. Each element must be named and correspond
to a variable included in the returned table. If \code{var_input} is set to \code{stem},
and any element is either unnamed or refers to a variable not present in the
table, all labels will be ignored and the table will be printed without them.}

\item{ignore}{An optional named vector or list indicating values to exclude
from variables matching specified stems (or names), and, if applicable, from
a grouping variable in \code{data}. Defaults to \code{NULL}, indicating that all values
are retained. To specify exclusions for variables identified by \code{var_stem},
use the corresponding stems or variable names as names in the vector or list.
To exclude multiple values from these variables or a grouping variable, supply
them as a named list.}
}
\value{
A tibble showing summary statistics for continuous variables, grouped
either by a specified variable in the dataset or by matching patterns in variable
names.
}
\description{
\code{select_group_tbl()} displays frequency counts and
percentages (i.e., count and percent) for multiple response variables,
including binary variables (such as Unselected/Selected) and ordinal
variables (such as responses ranging from strongly disagree to strongly
agree), that share a common variable stem, grouped either by another
variable in your dataset or by a matched pattern in the variable names.
A variable 'stem' is a shared naming pattern across related variables,
often representing repeated measures of the same concept or a series of
items measuring a single construct. Missing data are excluded using
\code{listwise} deletion by default.
