\usage{
mean_tbl(
  data,
  var_stem,
  var_input = "stem",
  regex_stem = FALSE,
  ignore_stem_case = FALSE,
  na_removal = "listwise",
  only = NULL,
  var_labels = NULL,
  ignore = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{var_stem}{A character vector containing at least one element,
each representing either a variable stem or a full variable name found
in \code{data}. A variable 'stem' is a shared naming pattern across related
variables, often representing repeated measures of the same concept or
a series of items measuring a single construct.}

\item{var_input}{A character string specifying whether the values supplied
to \code{var_stem} should be treated as variable stems (\code{stem}) or as complete
variable names (\code{name}). By default, this is set to \code{stem}, so the function
searches for variables that begin with each stem provided. Setting this
argument to \code{name} directs the function to look for variables that exactly
match the provided names.}

\item{regex_stem}{A logical value indicating whether to use Perl-compatible
regular expressions when searching for variable stems. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ignore_stem_case}{A logical value indicating whether the search for
columns matching the supplied \code{var_stem} is case-insensitive. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{na_removal}{A character string that specifies the method for handling
missing values: \code{pairwise} or \code{listwise}. Defaults to \code{listwise}.}

\item{only}{A character string or vector of character strings specifying
which summary statistics to return. Defaults to NULL, which includes mean
(mean), standard deviation (sd), minimum (min), maximum (max), and count
of non-missing values (nobs).}

\item{var_labels}{An optional named character vector or list used to assign
custom labels to variable names. Each element must be named and correspond
to a variable included in the returned table. If \code{var_input} is set to \code{stem},
and any element is either unnamed or refers to a variable not present in the
table, all labels will be ignored and the table will be printed without them.}

\item{ignore}{An optional named vector or list indicating values to exclude
from variables matching specified stems (or names). Defaults to \code{NULL},
indicating that all values are retained. To specify exclusions for variables
identified by \code{var_stem}, use the corresponding stems or variable names as
names in the vector or list. To exclude multiple values from these variables,
supply them as a named list.}
}
\value{
A tibble showing summary statistics for continuous variables.
}
\description{
\code{mean_tbl()} calculates summary statistics (i.e., mean,
standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and count of non-missing values)
for continuous (i.e., interval and ratio-level) variables.
